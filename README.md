# Solarized Dark for QTerminal/Konsole (with fixed colors)


## Installing

### QTerminal

Copy SolarizedDark.colorscheme to `~/.config/qterminal.org/color-schemes/` (create it if it doesn't exist)  
After that, you can select it in Preferences. It's called "SolarizedDark", remember that "Solarized" is the included version (with wrong colors for me)  

### Konsole

Copy `Solarized.colorscheme*` to `~/.kde/share/aps/konsole/`.
Then Konsole should present you with a Solarized option in colorschemes.
